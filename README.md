Hi! My name is Tommaso Ruzzon.
I am completing my Master in Quantitative Economics at LMU Munich.
I am particuarly interested in the applications of ML and NLP in Economics.
I hope my repositories below can showcase my work:
- honour_politeness is a project I developed from start to finish: I investigate how politeness on Twitter is influenced by historical cultures of honour in the US South.
- political_speeches contains links to Colab notebooks I wrote as part of a larger project on the analysis of German political speeches and surveys.
