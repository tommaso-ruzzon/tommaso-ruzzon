Hi! My name is Tommaso Ruzzon.

I am particularly interested in the applications of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Economics. 
I have extensive experience in data analysis and data visualization using R and Python. 
Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of SQL and of Business Intelligence softwares such as Tableau.

I hope my repositories below can properly showcase my work:

- honour_politeness: This is a project I developed from start to finish, investigating how politeness on Twitter is influenced by historical cultures of honor in the US South.
- political_speeches: This repository contains links to Colab notebooks that I created as part of a larger project focused on the analysis and classification of German political speeches and surveys.
